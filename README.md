# tic-tac-toe

Here is my [MVP](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27809/minimum-viable-product-mvp) for a game of Tic-tac-toe.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:hardbap/tic-tac-toe.git`

Switch into the cloned directory `cd tic-tac-toe`

Install the dependencies with `bundle install`

Fire it up `ruby tic-tac-toe.rb`

## Notes

* Currently the AI is very simple but a future version could be tuned to play an optimal game

* The human player always goes first
